**This project is under development.**

## How to install

Install the package through NPM

```bash
npm i -S @aliatech/loopback-diff-mixin
```

Install the package through Yarn

```bash
yarn add --prod @aliatech/loopback-diff-mixin
```

## Basic configuration

Include the mixin in `server/model-config.json`. Example for Loopback 3:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "sources": [
      "loopback/common/models",
      "loopback/server/models",
      "../common/models",
      "./models"
    ],
    "mixins": [
      "loopback/common/mixins",
      "../node_modules/@aliatech/loopback-diff-mixin/lib",
      "../common/mixins"
    ]
  }
}
```

Enable the mixin in your model definition, ie `person.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "Person",
  "properties": {
    "name": "string"
  },
  "mixins": {
    "Diff": {
      "hooks": {
        "email": "emailChanged"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

npm test # Without coverage check
npm run test-with-coverage # With coverage check
DEBUG=loopback:mixins:diff npm test # With debug
